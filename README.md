#### Feature #1: Responsive design
**Why are we implementing this feature?**
As a user, I want the dimensions and colors of the application to change so that I can have a unique view in desktop, mobile, and tablet viewports.
**What are we going to implement?**
Given that a user opens the application in the browser, on a tablet, or on a mobile device
When the user changes the size of the viewport
Then the boxes should scale proportionally and change colors

**How are we implementing it?**
Use Flexbox or CSS grids for styling this application.
Use relative units so the elements scale proportionally when the viewport dimensions change.

Use at least two breakpoints and change the background colors of each box. There should be three possible views: desktop, tablet, and mobile device. You may choose the exact pixel values for each breakpoint.
